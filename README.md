# 🌦️ Weather Data: Exploratory Data Analysis

Hi there! This project is a deep dive into a weather dataset to uncover patterns in temperature, wind speeds, and seasonal trends. I built this to practice cleaning "messy" data and turning raw numbers into visual stories.

## 🧐 Why this project?
I wanted to see what the numbers say about the environment we experience every day. I specifically focused on:
* **Wind Patterns:** Using KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots to see the "smooth" distribution of wind speeds.
* **Seasonal Trends:** Finding out which months actually hold the record for temperature swings.
* **Data Integrity:** Cleaning up missing values and fixing data types (like dates) that weren't playing nice.

## 🛠️ The Toolkit
* **Python 3.13**
* **Pandas:** My main tool for data manipulation and "wrangling."
* **Matplotlib & SciPy:** Used together to create the statistical visualizations.
* **Git:** For version control and keeping track of my progress.
